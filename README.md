# Web-App-for-3D-Object-segmentation-and-classification

Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective.
In this repository, we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes, as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.
